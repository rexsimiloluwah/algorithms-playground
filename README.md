This repository contains a curation of some Data structures or algorithms-based problems i have solved for learning or contest purposes using Python primarily. (PS :- To my future employer, please do not assess me by this codebase, haha. I am also trying to commit some time to solving an ALGORITHM PROBLEM A DAY, therefore enhancing my knowledge of useful data structures and algorithms)
