PROBLEM DESCRIPTION :- 

Lexicographic permutations are permutations of a series of digits sorted in ascending order. This problem involves finding the Nth lexicographic permutation of a series of digits. For example, given a series of digits '012', we know from basic maths that since there are 3 digits, there will be 3! permutations = 6 permutations. These permutations are :- 012, 021, 102, 120, 201, 210 when sorted in ascending order.

Hence the 4th permutation in the list of permutations is => 120

SAMPLE INPUT :- 

digit = 012
n = 4

OUTPUT :- 
120
